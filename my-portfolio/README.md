# My Portfolio (basic scaffold)

This folder contains a small static portfolio scaffold with an HTML page and CSS.

Files:

- `index.html` — main page with header (your name + nav), hero, About Me, and Skills sections.
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styling.

How to use:

1. Open `c:/Users/trout/Documents/VSCode/my-portfolio/index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with Browser).
2. Edit the name at the top of the page: replace "Your Name" with your real name in `index.html`.
3. Customize the About and Skills sections with your own text and add links to projects as needed.

Notes:
- The layout is intentionally minimal and easy to extend.
- If you prefer a different color theme, edit the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
