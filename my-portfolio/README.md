# My Portfolio (redone)

This folder contains a small static portfolio scaffold (HTML + CSS) you can open in a browser and edit.

Files:

- `index.html` — single-page portfolio with header (name + nav), hero, About Me, and Skills sections.
- `styles.css` — clean, responsive styles using CSS variables for easy theming.

Quick start

1. Open `c:/Users/trout/Documents/VSCode/my-portfolio/index.html` in your browser to preview.
2. Replace the placeholder "Your Name" in `index.html` with your real name.
3. Edit the About and Skills sections with your details. Add project links or a Projects section if desired.

Tips

- To change colors, edit the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css` (for example `--accent`, `--bg`).
- Use the Live Server extension in VS Code for automatic reload while you edit.

If you want, tell me your name and I will replace the placeholder for you, or I can add a Projects or Contact section next.
